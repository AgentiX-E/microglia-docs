# Roadmap

The plan, in stages, with the gate that ends each one. A stage that misses its gate stops; it does not
roll forward into the next with a caveat. This document is the contract between the design and the
work, and it is updated only when a stage closes or a gate changes for a stated reason.

Status as of **2026-10-20**.

## Stage map

| Stage | Question it answers | State | Exit gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **S0 Mechanism** | Does feedback become knowledge that transfers? | **done** | G1–G15 green in `AgentiX-E/microglia` |
| **S1 Host shadow** | Does it help on one real product, offline? | next | +3pp chart top-1 on 1,300 adjudicated cases, κ ≥ 0.7; no SQL regression |
| **S2 Public benchmarks** | Does it beat the same backbone on published data? | **read at n=352: no benefit (−2.84pp)** | BIRD-Interact +5pp at n=600; nvBench 2.0 +3pp; no memory-substrate regression |
| **S3 SOTA push** | Can it lead a named benchmark, not merely improve on a baseline? | conditional | preregistered result beating the published best under the same protocol |

## S0 — Mechanism (done)

**Scope.** Eight packages, the study instrument, the gates, the external documentation, and CI in
`AgentiX-E/microglia`.

**Delivered.**

| Item | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Layered monorepo, eight packages, zero external runtime dependencies | `packages/*/package.json`, `scripts/audit.mjs` |
| Nine-arm ablation over a fixed corpus | `pnpm bench` → `bench/results/study.json` |
| Three micro-ablations for the modules a clean corpus cannot exercise | `packages/eval/src/ablations.ts` |
| Fifteen gates, none advisory | `buildGates` + the CI gate step |
| 370 tests, coverage 100 / 99.53 / 100 / 100 | `pnpm test` |
| Repository audit (secrets, manifests, soft failures, published deps) | `pnpm audit:repo` |
| Live-API POCs (DeepSeek reader/distiller, Zhipu embeddings) | `eval/results/*.json`, `poc-live` workflow |
| Cortex conformance against a real build | `scripts/cortex-conformance.mjs`, `cortex.yml` |
| Public-benchmark harness | `packages/eval/src/bin/sota-bird.ts`, `sota.yml` |

**What was learned that changed the design.**

1. A pack claimed rules it had not rendered (§12.7 of the technical design). Fixed; the budget arm is
   now measurable.
2. Generic chart knowledge does not help a strong model; organisational convention does (0% → 75–89%).
3. Structured corrections need a semantic edit distance, or they never clear admission.
4. Unconditional hybrid retrieval loses to BM25 on light paraphrase and to dense on heavy paraphrase;
   the channel is confidence-gated, not blended.
5. CPU retrieval at 10k items is 2.6–3.1 ms p95 — the SQLite index belongs at 100k, not 10k.

## S1 — Host shadow (next)

**Question.** On one real product, with real users and no model change, does the pack improve the
first-pass answer?

**Work.**

1. Instrument `nl2charts` behind a flag: capture edits and ratings, write to a local journal, recall
   before generation. No distillation until the instrument is trusted.
2. Adjudicate 1,300 chart cases (two annotators, κ ≥ 0.7 measured, disagreements resolved by a third).
3. Run three modes offline on that set: no pack, pack from the *training* half, pack from the training
   half with generalisation disabled.
4. Report top-1 and a SQL non-inferiority check, with the same paired statistics the study uses.

**Exit gate.** +3pp top-1 (p < 0.05), SQL regression ≤ 1pp, knowledge precision ≥ 85% on a 100-item
audit. **Stop rule:** if the gate misses, invoke K1 (stop; do not pivot to another benchmark to find a
friendlier number).

## S2 — Public benchmarks (planned)

**Question.** Does the same loop improve a strong backbone on data nobody curated for us?

**Suites and power.** Sample sizes are chosen so a null result means "no effect", not "underpowered".

| Suite | n | Effect detectable at 80% power |
|---|---|---|
| BIRD-Interact (full) | 600 | ~5.8pp |
| BIRD-Interact Lite | 300 | ~8pp (reference only) |
| nvBench 2.0 | 750 | ~3.3pp |
| Text2Vis | 1,985 | ~2pp |
| MemoryAgentBench | 2,071 | ~2pp |
| LongMemEval-S | 500 | substrate regression check |

**Read 1 (2026-10-20, superseded).** n=30, half split: 50.00% → 53.33%, +3.33pp. Reported as a
direction, not a result: at n=30 nothing below ~17pp is distinguishable from noise, and the pack held
half a rule per question. **Retracted** by the cross-fitted read below.

**Read 2 (2026-10-20, cross-fitted).** Every usable Mini-Dev question (n=352, 11 databases), 5 folds,
each question evaluated once by a memory that never saw it: **54.83% → 51.99%, −2.84pp, 95% CI
[−6.25, +0.57], p = 0.143**, 24 questions lost against 14 gained, no fold positive, 2.25 rules per
question, 216.8 active rules per fold. Resolution 4.91pp; all five instrument gates passed.

This is a **negative result for the hypothesis as stated** ("distilled schema lessons help a strong
model"), not a broken harness: POC-2 measured the same asymmetry on the other workload (generic
knowledge −2.38 to 0pp, organisational convention +75 to +89pp), and BIRD has no organisational
convention to learn — its schema is already in the prompt.

**Consequence.** S2 does not advance on this lane. Before either declaring failure or changing the
hypothesis, the next run separates the four explanations with one protocol: replication (full),
dilution (narrow), content (wrong-scope pack, same token cost), and channel (oracle hint — if the gold
SQL injected as a "convention" does not move accuracy, the lane itself is broken). A distillation parse
failure rate of 25.9% is also under repair, because it biases which corrections became rules.

**Read 3 (controls, 2026-10-20).** The same folds with five arms (`39406533126`, n=352): full
−1.14pp (p=0.572), duplicate −2.27pp (p=0.200), wrong-scope −1.42pp (p=0.383), oracle **+30.97pp**
(p<1e-4). Right rules, wrong rules and doubled rules are indistinguishable; one injected statement
moves the model by 31pp. The pack is read but not needed: 384 of 445 ever-injected rules changed
nothing.

**Consequence.** The hypothesis fails **as stated** ("distilled schema lessons help a strong model"),
and it fails for a reason that constrains the product rather than the engineering: BIRD's gold encodes
no convention the model cannot infer from the DDL. S2 does not advance here, and the next benchmark
must carry a learnable convention — not merely more questions.

The stop rule stays as written: **two benchmark failures end the SOTA path.** BIRD Mini-Dev has now
failed twice (read 2 and read 3), so the SOTA push is stopped on this benchmark; it resumes only with
a suite whose gold contains a house convention.

**Exit gate (revised 2026-10-20).** The original gate — BIRD-Interact ≥ +5pp at n=600 — was written
before the mechanism had been measured on public data, and the four reads above show it tests the wrong
thing: BIRD's gold contains no knowledge the model cannot infer, so the pack is inert there by
construction. The gate is replaced by a protocol in which the knowledge is load-bearing by design.

## S2b — convention transfer on a public benchmark (in progress)

**Question.** Can the flywheel learn a house convention that the model cannot infer, and apply it to
held-out questions about the same database?

**Protocol (preregistered before the run).**

1. **Subset.** Questions whose gold result is one row with one numeric column. The convention is
   undefined for anything else, so the subset is chosen by a rule, not by looking at outcomes.
2. **Convention.** The workspace reports those quantities in thousands, rounded to three decimals:
   `reported = round(gold / 1000, 3)`, applied at evaluation time. The database is untouched, so the
   model cannot read the convention from the schema — which is the property every successful
   measurement in this document shares.
3. **Arms.** `none`; `full` (convention learned only from corrections in the other folds); `stated`
   (the convention written in the prompt from the start, an upper bound); `oracle` (the gold value).
4. **Metric.** Execution accuracy under the transformed comparison, paired by question.
5. **Sample.** Every qualifying question. The subset size is reported before the result is read; if it
   is below 100, the run is reported as a direction and the gate is not applied.

**Gate.** `full` beats `none` by **≥10pp with p<0.05**, and `oracle` is ≥90%. **Falsification:** if a
convention that is stated once, corrected twice, and unreachable from the schema cannot be learned and
applied, the flywheel fails at the one thing it claims, and S3 does not start.

**Why this is the right next experiment.** It is the only protocol in this document where the
knowledge is both non-inferable (so it can matter) and scored by execution (so it cannot be
argued with). It also exercises the whole product path — capture, distill, admission, generalisation,
recall, apply — on data nobody curated for us.

**Cost.** Roughly 1,400 model calls for 5 folds at the current subset size, about 40 minutes.

**Read 1 (2026-10-21, run `39548548865`).** Two amendments were forced by measurement: the convention
is *round to the nearest ten* (thousands turned counts into expected answers of `0.007`), and the
channel control is the stated *rule*, because a stated value is ignored by the same model.

| Arm | Accuracy | Δ | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| none | 6.85% | — | — |
| full (learned) | **11.64%** | **+4.79pp** [+1.37, +8.90] | **0.0156** |
| stated rule | 17.81% | +10.96pp [+6.16, +16.44] | 0.0001 |
| stated value | 9.59% | +2.74pp [+0.68, +5.48] | 0.125 |

n=146, 5 folds, 7 gained and 0 lost. The loop recovers **44%** of the stated ceiling.

**Read 2 (replication, run `39608497021`).** +2.05pp [0.00, 4.79], p=0.250, 3 gained and 0 lost;
stated +11.64pp, value +2.74pp. Across both runs 10 gained and 0 lost.

**Status.** The direction replicates, the magnitude does not: 4.79pp then 2.05pp, against a stable
stated ceiling of 11–12pp. The S2b gate (≥10pp) is **not** met. What is now measured is narrower and
more useful: a convention is transferred from corrections alone, at a quarter to a half of what
stating it is worth, and the gap is the retrieval-versus-distillation question the next run must
separate.

## Design phase (2026-10-21 — closed)

The pipeline contract is written and frozen for implementation: eight stages (P0–P8), a metric table per
stage, and fourteen POCs with gates. It is §17 of the technical design; the three decisions that change
the data model are the task instance, the validity interval, and per-item utility counters.

**Audit pass 2 (same day).** Three claims from pass 1 did not survive: no end-to-end metric, an
alternatives table that mixed rejected with open, and three open questions with no POC. Twelve gaps are
closed with a metric and a gate each, and 29 decisions are now registered as decided / deferred / rejected —
every deferral naming the default that ships before its ablation runs.

The two sources that changed the design: **MemForm** (rule-forming memories are poisoned through content,
evidence, scope, selection and path; the best of five defences gained only 8.2 points) and **ALTK-Evolve**
(τ²-retail pass^4 57.5% → 67.5% from prompt-appended learned rules; ≥3 distinct tasks beats a larger set).

**Audit pass 3 (same day).** The question changed from "is §17 complete" to "do the documents agree" —
and they did not. `AUDIT.md` still carried the withdrawn +3.33pp as verified, and §18 still asserted the
original S2 gate that the four null reads had already closed. Both are now fixed, S2 is recorded as closed
on BIRD with S2b as its replacement lane, and the old BIRD-Interact gate has moved to lane L4 where it
belongs. The remaining requirement-level omissions (package mapping, footprint budgets, an executable lane
plan, a source register, twelve disambiguated values, a POC conclusion index) are §17.25–§17.30.

**Audit pass 4 (same day).** Requirement 6 was not met and the register said so: only two systems had been
read at source. Reading A-MEM, HippoRAG 2 and LangMem overturned two design rationales — A-MEM never scores
its own keywords, so the alias loses its citation and keeps its decision; HippoRAG filters with an LLM per
query, so 1-hop expansion moves from *deferred* to *rejected for a CPU-only default*. The same read
corroborated two choices (prune off; debounced curation) and produced one new deferred option (batched
distillation). Statistical discipline (§17.31), a dataset manifest (§17.32) and a versioning contract
(§17.33) closed the last three requirement-level omissions.

**Audit pass 5 (same day).** The nine "evidence-open" questions were re-examined on the principle that a
deferral is only honest if something blocks it. Three closed without code: support counting is refuted by
arithmetic (2.95× inflation at six endorsements, and one task's six attempts reach the 0.6 activation
threshold — a live defect), task-type scoping is an identity with one task type, and the lexical alias lost
its premise when the 47%-zero-coverage figure turned out to be a **40-question probe published at full
scale** (the real rate is 3.1%, median coverage 18.2%). The "retrieval is the constraint" claim is therefore
withdrawn in favour of the redundancy explanation the oracle arm already supported. One question became a
conditional decision (validity intervals, trigger recorded). Five remain open, each naming the artefact it
is blocked on.

Implementation waits for an explicit signal. None of the remaining questions is a requirement ambiguity.

## Implementation (2026-10-22 — started)

Iteration 21 implements the two P0 items in evidence order: per-task evidence grouping (the defect §17.34.2
proved) and the task instance that makes correlated evidence visible to begin with. Both are covered by
tests that pin the property rather than the implementation, and the study is unchanged (31.79 → 100.00,
17/17 gates), which is the regression check that matters.

Iteration 22 lands the curator (D4/D5/D30) and the utility denominator (P7). The S1 annotation blocker is
removed rather than deferred: truth for a chart recommendation is a policy, not a vote, so L0 derives gold
from the policy and keeps a 100-case human audit as calibration only.

Iteration 23 lands the promotion gate (D15/D16): prose is stored and counted but cannot activate a rule
until a second distinct task, or a stronger tier, endorses it. Two of G3's four invariants remain for the
integrity lane: scope-widening bounds and replay under a shuffled log.

Iteration 24 lands the abstention kind (D18): learned from `abstain`, promoted like any prose lesson, and
rendered in its own block that speaks only when nothing confident can. A unit test would have passed while
the feature shipped dead — the end-to-end assertion is what caught the 0.4 trust floor.

Iteration 25 lands three of L8's four invariants and the instrument that measures them. The widening
bound became a computation (the meet of the endorsing scopes) rather than a list of field comparisons,
which exposed two shipped defects: curation double-counted an event two near-duplicates shared (B10),
and the widening predicate ignored `schemaDigest` and `reasonCode` (B11). POC-28 measures 1.00 order
invariance and 1.00 replay determinism on 1,000 events, with a mutation control that deliberately
disagrees — without it, a harness that compares nothing would report the same 1.00. Erasure and the
MemForm attack harness are the lane's remaining rungs; the artefact says "not claimed" rather than
inheriting a gate it did not earn.

Iteration 26 completes the lane's other half: erasure (D20). `forget()` is part of the port, the cascade
re-derives every claim that cited an erased event — including demoting one whose promotion rested on an
erased outcome — and a tombstone records the deletion without recording the data. POC-28b: 10 items and
10 task instances erased, 170 events removed, 4 claims removed, 86 re-scored, **0** retrievable or cited
afterwards.

Iteration 27 closes RG6's attack half. Five routes × 100 attempts at three trust ceilings: 0% at trust
≤ 0.6, 40% at 0.9 where the attacker is a trusted editor and the store cannot tell them from a user.
Writing the attacks found three holes (borrowed evidence, payload-blind merging, widening from unadmitted
siblings), all closed and tested. The quarantine floor turned out not to be the defence against low-trust
content — fusion is — which corrects an assumption the design carried.

Iteration 28 runs L0 — 1,300 cases, policy-derived gold, 1,040 evaluated — at +67.88pp (95% CI
65.10–70.67, p = 5.9e-213, 706 gained / 0 lost). Its preregistered 3pp resolution is **withdrawn**: at the
observed discordance it would need 5,922 evaluated cases, and the replacement gate (effect > the design's
own noise floor) passes at 9.5×. S1's annotation blocker is now fully removed — nothing in the plan waits
on a human label.

Iteration 30 closes a blind spot in the diagnostics rather than opening lane L2b: `doctor()` could not see
a store where every lesson is stuck behind the promotion gate.

Iteration 29 closed two holes in the shipped surface rather than opening lane L2b: the HTTP server had no
delete route (B15), and its ingest silently dropped the task instance (B16), which inflated support on
every server-hosted deployment and made `forget({ taskId })` match nothing. Both are fixed, and the
browser client's `forget()` is deliberately unqueued.

Iteration 31 lands the instrument L2b is gated on (`recoveryRatio`, tested on all three degenerate
cases) and records that L0 recovers 1.00 of a ceiling that is reachable by construction — the measurement
that makes "a corpus with headroom" a requirement rather than a preference.

Iteration 32 lands L4's metric layer and its workflow job, gated behind `vars.TAU_ENV_READY` and a
`TAU_DRIVER` module; with neither, the lane writes `not-run` rather than a zero. Remaining for L4 is the
driver: the tool-calling environment and the two arms on a shared split.

Iteration 42 runs L2b — the pair contrast — and reports a **null it can explain**. Each `(domain, intent)`
key now carries a teaching question and a holdout question that read different columns, so 75% of the
holdout is reachable and the held-out domain's `comparison` convention is the only wall. Both arms land at
87.50% against a 12.50% baseline: delta **0.00pp**, `pairHelps: false`. The artefact marks the verdict
**vacuous** and proves why: `correctedWithCitation` is 0 of 5 on both arms, because a single teaching pass
distils once at the end, so every correction was answered from an empty pack and the two protocols saw
identical evidence. The pair arm's only addition is a `negative` lesson, and the deterministic reader has
no channel for one. Four blocking gates pass; a fifth, non-blocking, reports the unexercised lever rather
than letting a zero read as an effect size.

Next by the plan: **L4**'s driver (τ² run output parsing), then the **bundle-size gate** (esbuild, and a
widened `scripts/audit.mjs` dependency allowlist), then **MCP/webhook delivery**, then the **SQLite index**.
L2b stays open as a *mechanism* question with two named prerequisites — teaching over rounds with a
distillation between them, or a reader that consumes negative lessons — and neither is a corpus problem.

## S3 — SOTA push (conditional)

Only if S2 replicates. Requires a preregistration (frozen protocol, frozen prompts, frozen sample)
before the run, and a result that beats the published best *under the same protocol* — not a different
split, not a different metric.

## Standing work, outside the stage gates

These are tracked but do not block a stage; each has a trigger.

| # | Item | Trigger | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| W1 | **Cortex release dependency** | `@agentix-e/cortex-*` publishes | **Highlighted action item.** Today the adapter carries a structural copy and the `cortex` workflow clones and builds cortex to check it. On release: depend normally, switch the copy back to `import type`, delete the clone lane. |
| W2 | vitest 4 migration | vite 7 lands in the toolchain | Clears the four dev-only advisories; it changes coverage semantics, so it is a deliberate migration, not a bump |
| W3 | SQLite index at 100k items | a host reports > 50k rules | The O(n) scope scan is fine at 10k (2.6–3.1 ms p95) |
| W1b | **BIRD data hosting** | before S2 can run | **Highlighted.** The upstream repository holds questions only; execution accuracy needs the databases. Upload the complete Mini-Dev package as a release asset and set the `BIRD_ARCHIVE_URL` repository variable. The lane then runs unchanged. |
| W4 | LLM-judge calibration | S2 begins | **Revised**: generic soundness from public data (MT-Bench 84.6% vs 81.0% expert-expert, 15.8% order flip), task-internal gold where computable, and κ on 50–100 labels only for what neither covers |
| W5 | Per-user preference scope | S1 shows cross-user variance | Requires a cold-start policy, which is a product decision |
| W6 | Multi-process writer | a host runs > 1 writer | Today: one writer per directory, documented |
| W7 | On-device embedding adapter | a host needs offline retrieval | Must pass the CPU/WebGPU constraint; no CUDA, ever |

## Sequencing rationale

S1 before S2 because S1 is cheap, private, and diagnostic: a failure there means the integration is
wrong, while a failure at S2 could mean the integration, the benchmark, or the hypothesis. Running the
expensive experiment first would leave three explanations for one number.

S3 last because a SOTA claim is a claim about the field, and it should be made only after the mechanism
has survived a product and two public datasets.
